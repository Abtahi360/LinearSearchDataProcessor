# LinearSearchDataProcessor
LinearSearchDataProcessor is a C++ program designed to demonstrate the linear search algorithm on a large dataset. The program generates a dataset of 100,000 random integers, writes it to a file, reads the data from the file, and performs a linear search to find the occurrence of a specified number.

#Features
-> Data Generation: Generates a file with 100,000 random integers.
-> Data Reading: Reads the generated data from the file into an array.
-> Linear Search: Performs a linear search on the array to find a specified number and reports its occurrence and indices.

#Functions
-> void linear_Search(int a[], int n, int num): Searches for the specified number in the array and reports its occurrence and indices.
-> void data_generate(int n, int data): Generates a file with n random integers.
-> void data_read(int n, int a[]): Reads data from the file into an array.
