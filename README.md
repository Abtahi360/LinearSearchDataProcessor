# LinearSearchDataProcessor
LinearSearchDataProcessor is a C++ program designed to demonstrate the linear search algorithm on a large dataset. The program generates a dataset of 100,000 random integers, writes it to a file, reads the data from the file, and performs a linear search to find the occurrence of a specified number.

# Features
1. Data Generation: Generates a file with 100,000 random integers.
2. Data Reading: Reads the generated data from the file into an array.
3. Linear Search: Performs a linear search on the array to find a specified number and reports its occurrence and indices.

# Functions
1. void linear_Search(int a[], int n, int num): Searches for the specified number in the array and reports its occurrence and indices.
2. void data_generate(int n, int data): Generates a file with n random integers.
3. void data_read(int n, int a[]): Reads data from the file into an array.
